<overview>
TDD is about design quality, not coverage metrics. The red-green-refactor cycle forces you to think about behavior before implementation, producing cleaner interfaces and more testable code.

**Principle:** If you can describe the behavior as `expect(fn(input)).toBe(output)` before writing `fn`, TDD improves the result.

**Key insight:** TDD work is fundamentally heavier than standard tasks—it requires 2-3 execution cycles (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR), each with file reads, test runs, and potential debugging. TDD features get dedicated plans to ensure full context is available throughout the cycle.

<when_to_use_tdd>
## When TDD Improves Quality

**TDD candidates (create a TDD plan):**
- Business logic with defined inputs/outputs
- API endpoints with request/response contracts
- Data transformations, parsing, formatting
- Validation rules and constraints
- Algorithms with testable behavior
- State machines and workflows
- Utility functions with clear specifications

**Skip TDD (use standard plan with `type="auto"` tasks):**
- UI layout, styling, visual components
- Configuration changes
- Glue code connecting existing components
- One-off scripts and migrations
- Simple CRUD with no business logic
- Exploratory prototyping

**Heuristic:** Can you write `expect(fn(input)).toBe(output)` before writing `fn`?
→ Yes: Create a TDD plan
→ No: Use standard plan, add tests after if needed

<tdd_plan_structure>
## TDD Plan Structure

Each TDD plan implements **one feature** through the full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle.

```markdown
---
phase: XX-name
plan: NN
type: tdd
---

<objective>
[What feature and why]
Purpose: [Design benefit of TDD for this feature]
Output: [Working, tested feature]
</objective>

<context>
@.planning/PROJECT.md
@.planning/ROADMAP.md
@relevant/source/files.ts
</context>

<feature>
  <name>[Feature name]</name>
  <files>[source file, test file]</files>
  <behavior>
    [Expected behavior in testable terms]
    Cases: input → expected output
  </behavior>
  <implementation>[How to implement once tests pass]</implementation>
</feature>

<verification>
[Test command that proves feature works]
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Failing test written and committed
- Implementation passes test
- Refactor complete (if needed)
- All 2-3 commits present
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create SUMMARY.md with:
- RED: What test was written, why it failed
- GREEN: What implementation made it pass
- REFACTOR: What cleanup was done (if any)
- Commits: List of commits produced
</output>
```

**One feature per TDD plan.** If features are trivial enough to batch, they're trivial enough to skip TDD—use a standard plan and add tests after.
</tdd_plan_structure>

<execution_flow>
## Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

**RED - Write failing test:**
1. Create test file following project conventions
2. Write test describing expected behavior (from `<behavior>` element)
3. Run test - it MUST fail
4. If test passes: feature exists or test is wrong. Investigate.
5. Commit: `test({phase}-{plan}): add failing test for [feature]`

**GREEN - Implement to pass:**
1. Write minimal code to make test pass
2. No cleverness, no optimization - just make it work
3. Run test - it MUST pass
4. Commit: `feat({phase}-{plan}): implement [feature]`

**REFACTOR (if needed):**
1. Clean up implementation if obvious improvements exist
2. Run tests - MUST still pass
3. Only commit if changes made: `refactor({phase}-{plan}): clean up [feature]`

**Result:** Each TDD plan produces 2-3 atomic commits.
</execution_flow>

<test_quality>
## Test Quality and Granularity

### Unit+1 Style

Prefer **unit+1 tests** (also known as **shallow integration tests**) over pure unit tests or full integration tests.

| Level | What it means | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Unit** | Mock direct dependencies | Mock the database in a Django test |
| **Unit+1** (preferred) | Use direct dependencies, mock what's slow/external | Call User.create() with real DB, mock 2FA service |
| **Full integration** | Real everything | Hit actual 2FA service |

**Why unit+1:**
- Tests real interactions between your code and its immediate dependencies
- Still fast (mocks cut off slow/external things)
- Catches integration bugs that pure unit tests miss
- More maintainable than mocking every direct dependency

**How deep is "+1"?** There's no fixed rule. The boundary depends on the situation — what's slow, what's external, and what interactions matter for the behavior you're testing. A unit+1 test for a service with a database is different from a unit+1 test for a parser with a formatter. Use judgment: go deep enough to test real interactions, shallow enough to stay fast.

**Mock at the slow/external boundary, not at your code's direct dependencies.**

**What to mock (slow/external):** Network calls, third-party services, file I/O, timers, non-deterministic operations.
**What to use real (direct dependencies):** Your own modules, database queries (test DB), framework utilities, validation logic.

### Test Quality

**Test behavior, not implementation:**
- Good: "returns formatted date string"
- Bad: "calls formatDate helper with correct params"

**One concept per test.**
**Descriptive names:** "should reject empty email", not "test1".
**No implementation details:** Test public API, not private methods or internal state.

### Mocking Boundaries

When creating mock responses, mirror the **complete** real data structure, not just the fields your immediate test uses. Downstream code may depend on fields you omitted.

If mock setup is longer than test logic, you're mocking at the wrong level. Mock further from your code, at the slow/external boundary.
</test_quality>

<framework_setup>
## Test Framework Setup (If None Exists)

When executing a TDD plan but no test framework is configured, set it up as part of the RED phase:

**1. Detect project type:**
```bash
# JavaScript/TypeScript
if [ -f package.json ]; then echo "node"; fi

# Python
if [ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f pyproject.toml ]; then echo "python"; fi

# Go
if [ -f go.mod ]; then echo "go"; fi

# Rust
if [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then echo "rust"; fi
```

**2. Install minimal framework:**
| Project | Framework | Install |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Node.js | Jest | `npm install -D jest @types/jest ts-jest` |
| Node.js (Vite) | Vitest | `npm install -D vitest` |
| Python | pytest | `pip install pytest` |
| Go | testing | Built-in |
| Rust | cargo test | Built-in |

**3. Create config if needed:**
- Jest: `jest.config.js` with ts-jest preset
- Vitest: `vitest.config.ts` with test globals
- pytest: `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml` section

**4. Verify setup:**
```bash
# Run empty test suite - should pass with 0 tests
npm test  # Node
pytest    # Python
go test ./...  # Go
cargo test    # Rust
```

**5. Create first test file:**
Follow project conventions for test location:
- `*.test.ts` / `*.spec.ts` next to source
- `__tests__/` directory
- `tests/` directory at root

Framework setup is a one-time cost included in the first TDD plan's RED phase.
</framework_setup>

<error_handling>
## Error Handling

**Test doesn't fail in RED phase:**
- Feature may already exist - investigate
- Test may be wrong (not testing what you think)
- Fix before proceeding

**Test doesn't pass in GREEN phase:**
- Debug implementation
- Don't skip to refactor
- Keep iterating until green

**Tests fail in REFACTOR phase:**
- Undo refactor
- Commit was premature
- Refactor in smaller steps

**Unrelated tests break:**
- Stop and investigate
- May indicate coupling issue
- Fix before proceeding
</error_handling>

<commit_pattern>
## Commit Pattern for TDD Plans

TDD plans produce 2-3 atomic commits (one per phase):

```
test(08-02): add failing test for email validation

- Tests valid email formats accepted
- Tests invalid formats rejected
- Tests empty input handling

feat(08-02): implement email validation

- Regex pattern matches RFC 5322
- Returns boolean for validity
- Handles edge cases (empty, null)

refactor(08-02): extract regex to constant (optional)

- Moved pattern to EMAIL_REGEX constant
- No behavior changes
- Tests still pass
```

**Comparison with standard plans:**
- Standard plans: 1 commit per task, 2-4 commits per plan
- TDD plans: 2-3 commits for single feature

Both follow same format: `{type}({phase}-{plan}): {description}`

**Benefits:**
- Each commit independently revertable
- Git bisect works at commit level
- Clear history showing TDD discipline
- Consistent with overall commit strategy
</commit_pattern>

<context_budget>
## Context Budget

TDD plans target **~40% context usage** (lower than standard plans' ~50%).

Why lower:
- RED phase: write test, run test, potentially debug why it didn't fail
- GREEN phase: implement, run test, potentially iterate on failures
- REFACTOR phase: modify code, run tests, verify no regressions

Each phase involves reading files, running commands, analyzing output. The back-and-forth is inherently heavier than linear task execution.

Single feature focus ensures full quality throughout the cycle.
